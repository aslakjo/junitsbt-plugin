h1. Junit sbt plugin

This is a plugin that makes it super easy to run your junit tests in sbt. Which seams to be the easiest way to get
incrimental test running which gives instant feedback.

h2. Install

Add the following line to your plugins file (which is located at project/plugins/Plugins.scala):

bq. val junitPlugin = "no.aslakjo" % "junitsbt-plugin" % "1.0" from "http://cloud.github.com/downloads/aslakjo/junitsbt-plugin/junitsbt-plugin-1.0.jar"

What it does is giving you a trait called "Junit" which you have to mix in to your project file. Like so:


bq. import junitsbtplugin._   class Project(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) with JUnit{}

Now you can run "reload", "update" then "~ test-quick" and watch the magic unfold.

h2. Credits

This is all possible due to a sbt testframwork interface for junit that "Bryan J Swift":http://bryanjswift.com/ has made.
